## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

1. read in data
```{r}
#spatial data
library(sf)
library(here)
spain <- sf::st_read(here("Wk3 Homework", "Data source", "gadm41_ESP.gpkg"),
                     layer='ADM_ADM_0')
world_cities <- sf::st_read(here("Wk3 Homework", "Data source", "World_Cities", "World_Cities.shp"))

#climate data
library(raster)
library(terra)
SSP1 <- terra::rast(here("Wk3 Homework", "Data source", "wc2.1_2.5m_tmax_GISS-E2-1-G_ssp126_2021-2040.tif"))
SSP5 <- terra::rast(here("Wk3 Homework", "Data source", "wc2.1_2.5m_tmax_GISS-E2-1-G_ssp585_2021-2040.tif"))
```
2. filter cities
```{r}
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
Spanish_cities <- world_cities %>%
  janitor::clean_names(.)%>%
  dplyr::filter(cntry_name=='Spain')
```
3. manipulate data
```{r}
# SSP1
spain_diff1 <- SSP1 %>%
  terra::crop(.,spain)
exact_spain1 <- spain_diff1 %>%
  terra::mask(.,spain)
# SSP5
spain_diff5 <- SSP5 %>%
  terra::crop(.,spain)
exact_spain5 <- spain_diff5 %>%
  terra::mask(.,spain)
# difference
diff_climate <- exact_spain5 - exact_spain1
# rename
month <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", 
           "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")
names(diff_climate) <- month
# extract data point
spain_cities_diff <- terra::extract(diff_climate, Spanish_cities)
```
4. join the data
```{r}
Spanish_cities_join_ID <- Spanish_cities%>%
  dplyr::mutate(join_ID= 1:n())
spain_cities_diff2 <- Spanish_cities_join_ID%>%
  left_join(.,
            spain_cities_diff,
            by = c('join_ID'='ID'))
```
5. tidy up the data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
tidy_city_diff <- spain_cities_diff2 %>%
  dplyr::select(c(.,16:27))%>%
  st_drop_geometry(.)%>%
  as_tibble()%>%
  pivot_longer(everything(),
              names_to = "Months",
              values_to = "temp_diff")
```
6. facet plot
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
facet_plot <- tidy_city_diff %>%
  drop_na()%>% 
  mutate(Months = factor(Months, levels = c("Jan","Feb","Mar",
                                          "Apr","May","Jun",
                                          "Jul","Aug","Sep",
                                          "Oct","Nov","Dec")))
facet_plot1 <- ggplot(facet_plot, aes(x=temp_diff, na.rm=TRUE))+
  geom_histogram(color="black", binwidth = .1)+
  labs(title="Facet plots of Spanish temp_diff", 
       x="Temperature",
       y="Frequency")+
  facet_grid(Months ~ .)+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
facet_plot1
```
